DGS allows processing of SVG 'template images' which are combined with various bits of data and processing commands in order to produce a production image with the result of the additional data and processing commands.

The resulting output image may be another SVG image, PDF, or rasterized into more widely supported format for the web such as PNG, JPEG, TIFF or GIF (Animation included).

A J2EE web app and command line interface are currently provided.  The Apache Batik project is used to provide the backend SVG handling.

This project has just been created, existing source and documentation will be uploaded shortly.
